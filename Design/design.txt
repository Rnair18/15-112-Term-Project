The project focuses on helping people articulate english words or phrases. It does this in two ways. One is that it provides users with an AI's (built in text to speech) voice of each of the words and their phonetic translation. Additionally I have added algorithms that focus on the analysis of the user's recorded voice in determining wether they are pronouncing the word correctly.

The primary algorithms I used revolved around peak detection. Peaks in the time domain for a voice signal...correspond to transitions between different vowels and my program identifies where these peaks are relative to the AI's voice signal. It then also compares the relative length of each of these peaks which dictates the amount of stress put on that syllable. With this information, I generate text to adequately inform the user on how to improve their pronounciation.

Since the program itself aims to solve a problem in communication, I designed the GUI to be very simplistic and easy to use. The colors are very calming to make the user feel comfortable. Additionally the instruction page as well as each widget having helper texts that go along with it, aid the user no matter what screen they are in. As I expect users to be trying out multiple words back and forth, the navigation between the main, pronunciation, and analysis pages are also very straightforward.
